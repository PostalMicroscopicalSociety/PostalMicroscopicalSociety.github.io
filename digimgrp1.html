Those of you who have attended recent society meetings may be aware that the PMS has been donated a copy of Syncroscopy's (make web link) Auto-Montage. This is a computer program that takes in a series of microscope images which have been produced by focusing in steps over the vertical extent of an object. Auto Montage can automatically stitch together the in-focus parts of each photo, in the series, to produce a single view with an enhanced depth of field. Additionally, because the program has information about which layer each in-focus part comes from, it can generate stereo pairs, or ,if preferred, anagylph views (stereo picture viewed through red-green spectacles).<br><br>



Needless to say, getting good results is not quite straightforward as the section on preparing, etc indicates, nevertheless, with care, good results can be obtained. Some examples are given below. Click on the thumbnail pictures to see enlarged versions. Ananglyph versions will require red-green spectacles to view correctly (red-blue will do).<br><br>



In practice, the PMS copy will only work on a computer fitted with a dongle (a hardware key plugged into a USB port). This makes it impractical to pass the application around to club members. To cope with this the Society will provide a service, to PMS members only, to process any images provided. In the first instance contact MEC. For practical purposes images should be provided on a CD. The results can then be returned, also on CD and the best ones can be shown on this web-site.<br><br>

Guidelines for Generating Microscope Images for Use with Auto-Montage

(PMS members only)



Principles of Auto-Montage:



The application takes in a series of images taken at discrete levels in an object and automatically stitches them together to produce a single image. Only the in-focus parts of each image are used and the final montage image is, therefore, in focus over the whole of the object. Different stitching algorithms are provided in order to optimise the result for any particular object. The application also retains the level information for each portion of in-focus image used and is able to use this information to generate stereo views of the object.



What Auto-Montage Requires:



Focus level change between adjacent images:

Adjacent images should be taken at a spacings within the depth of focus of the microscope lenses. If the steps are too far apart then Auto-Montage will not be able to produce good correlation between images. Ideally the depth of focus of the lens system should be calculated and a calibrated focus knob used to provide accurate and equal steps between images. In practice it is usually satisfactory to set the steps by feel.



Alignment between images:

Images taken through a stereo microscope will shift sideways significantly as the focus is changed. Auto-Montage can cope with misalignment between images and compensate in both X and Y directions. The alignment is selectable and subsequent montage operations are carried out on the aligned images.



Good contrast over whole image:

Image lighting is very important. Areas of low contrast will not be used in the montaged image and will appear to float out of place in the stereo views. Auto-Montage does provide a manual clone tool for correcting such defects, but it is awkward and time-consuming to use. Top-lit objects can be prone to having parts in shadow or washed out highlights. The ideal lighting system would be a bright but diffuse top light. Transmitted light objects should ideally not have areas which are very dark, or conversely very light. Some image processing can be carried out in computer, to alleviate the worst problems, but it would be very time consuming on a large series of images.



Tips for Producing a Satisfactory Series of Images:



Care in taking a series:

Focus through the full range of the object, noting the features at the highest and lowest points in the object; these will act as markers for starting and ending the series. The direction of focus is not important as the whole series can be inverted in Auto-Montage. Start at one end of the focus range and take small enough steps to ensure that the image detail only changes slightly between shots (unless you are using the pre-calculated steps).



Try to make each step equal, in terms of focus knob angle turned through.



Use a remote release on the camera (e.g. air bulb) to minimise the chance of disturbing the set up. In particular sit as still as possible and, with unmounted specimens be careful not to disturb them by breathing on them during a photo session.



Examples of Series Which have Proved Satisfactory:



House fly head:

The top-lit, unmounted, head filled the camera frame height and 36 images were taken. If some object appendage, such as an antenna, protrudes significantly then proportionately more images will be required, or it may be better to trim the specimen.



Mounted blowfly labella:

The labella filled the camera frame and 13 images were taken.



Images used were 1600 * 1200 pixels, and Auto-Montage stalls on images bigger than this, although it is not clear that this is a limitation of the application.

An Ideal Setup:



Microscope with trinocular head.

Versatile, controllable lighting.

Digital camera fitted with adapted, high eyepoint, wide-field eyepiece.

Remote camera release.

Colour monitor to connect to the camera to give an enlarged image for checking image focus.

Computer with means for taking in images from camera.

Image processing software for detailed checking of images (e.g. PaintShopPro or PhotoShop).

CD writer for transferring images to CD for ease of posting to core group members for image processing by Auto-Montage. 



Other Methods Which can be Employed:



Any microscope.

Versatile, controllable lighting.

Film camera with lens removed, adapted to fit on microscope.

Slides or prints which can be posted directly and scanned into a computer  by a core group member. Prints of results can be sent back by, for example, Jessops Print@net service.

Postal costs can be sorted out on an individual basis.



 Core Group Members:



At present the only active members are Mick Chaplin and Keith Brocklehurst.
