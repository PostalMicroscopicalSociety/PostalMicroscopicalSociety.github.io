<font face="Arial" size="4">Compiler&rsquo;s Notes
<br>Responses to my requests for dates from the various Natural History organisations has exceeded my expectations somewhat. As a result the diary this year is a little larger than that produced last year.
<br>As last year, however, the number of entries in the first six months far exceeds those for later months. Not many organisations have planned that far ahead. Nonetheless, I have included those months where little appears to be happening and left space in the Notes section for you to fill in as and when dates appear.

<br>To the rear is a list of all the organisations included in the diary and it is recommended that you use these in conjunction with the entries to confirm that stated events are to take place and have not been moved or cancelled.
<br>Should you have the time, inclination and petrol money you could almost visit an event a day for the first three months.
<br>
<br>It is highly likely that we have only scratched the surface with the organisations referenced to date. There must be many more out there, particularly local societies, that should be included.
<br>
<br>Once again, if the response from the membership is positive then I will look to produce a similar diary for 2006.  The cost, however, is something that we will need to consider and a cooperation with some of the other organisations might be an option. If the leaders of such would like to contact me then the Diary future would be secured.
<br>As regards next years diary, and assuming that some form of shared funding materialises, I would like to include a seasonal photograph with each month - any subject (remember that this will be printed in greyscale). I would beseech you to send me suitable images. If they are not used in the Diary then I&rsquo;m sure they could be used elsewhere. Full recognition will be given to the photographer.
<br>
<br>One thing that has become apparent in compiling this Diary is that a full (or as full as possible) directory of Societies and Clubs would be a positive boon. If every member were to compile a list of local clubs and societies with a leaning towards the natural sciences then the accumulated records could be published either via the web site or perhaps as a booklet.
<br>This would be a valuable asset to all members, particularly in the winter months when not much is happening on the Microsope circuit.
