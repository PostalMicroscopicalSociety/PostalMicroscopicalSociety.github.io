		<b><div style="text-align: center">TOPIC No 1 - THREE DIATOMS FROM YORKSHIRE</div></b><br>
<div style="text-align: center">By
Rev. Dingley P. Fuge.
(Article taken from Watson's Microscope Record May 1931).</div><br><br>


There is no diatomist who is not keenly alive to the beauty of the diatoms that come to him from the tropic seas, or who does not hail with delight the opportunity of investigating the contents of some rare fossil deposit.<br> It is to be feared, however, that there are some who are not aware of the interest of forms that may be collected at their own door. It is true that these may not possess the beauty of some of the finer tropical forms, but they are graceful enough, and at times the problems they suggest are extremely fascinating. It is to illustrate some of the points that may arise when such a gathering is examined that the following notes have been written.

In October of last year two gatherings of diatoms were made on the moors, just outside Bradford in Yorkshire. The samples were collected within a few hundred yards of a bus terminal and within five yards of each other. The first consisted of algae drawn by a stick from a tiny streamlet only an inch or two deep. Here were abundant diatoms, but they were true to type and belonged to common species. The second gathering was made by squeezing into a tube the water from a handful of Sphagnum growing in a marshy spot.
<br><br><div style="text-align: center"><img src="pict2432.jpg" border="0" width="709" height="717" alt="" align="middle"><br><br></div> 

It contained at least a score of species or varieties, six or eight of which were of more than usual interest. From these three Naviculas are selected and illustrated, partly for their intrinsic interest and partly because they afford opportunity for certain remarks that may be helpful to a beginner.<br><br>

	<b>I--Navicula distinguenda  CLEVE.</b><br><br>
												                     
When the cleaned forms were brought under the microscope the first noticed was a large Pinnularia. Pinnularia is a sub-genus of Navicula. Its forms are easily recognised and the division is of value in that it separates at once a large group from an enormous genus. At first glance the form in question seemed to be one of the varieties of Nav.major, though there was an air of  &ldquo;unusualness&rdquo; about it even under low power.<br>  A higher power revealed the fact that the raphe was &ldquo;complex&rdquo;, and since one of the chief characteristics of major is a simple or oblique raphe, it was evident that further search was necessary. Reference to Cleve's &ldquo;Naviculoid Diatoms&rdquo; showed that our diatom agreed for point with that which he names distinguenda. This form is very close to viridis, differing perhaps only in size and the modern tendency is to refer to it as N. viridis var distinguenda. Possibly the form &ldquo;a&rdquo; in the plate showing viridis in Wm. Smith's &ldquo;British Diatoms&rdquo; is meant to represent this form.
<br><br>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="pict2433.jpg" border="0" width="677" height="450" alt="" align="middle"></div><br><br>

The raphe is the most noteworthy feature in the Pinnularias. It is the line in the centre of the valve surface, and runs from end to end, being broken only by the central nodule.  It is a cleft in the valve wall and exists in three conditions.<br><br>
1	As a cleft, perpendicular from top to bottom. Then it appears as a single line and is termed &ldquo;filiform&rdquo;.<br><br>
2	When it runs obliquely from top to bottom of the valve wall (i.e. when the bottom of the raphe does not lie immediately under the upper line. And when this divergence persists in the same direction and is not folded on itself) the raphe appears as a broad simple line and is termed &ldquo;oblique&rdquo;.<br><br>
3	When the central line is twisted on itself because the upper and lower portions of the cleft are both wavy, and the upper and lower waves do not coincide, the raphe is &ldquo;complex&rdquo;.<br><br>
These conditions are diagrammatically illustrated in Fig 1V.<br><br> 
Possession of a &ldquo;complex&rdquo; raphe is the feature of a group of species among which viridis is numbered and which separates it and its congeners from the group which contains major and its allies.<br> It is, however not always easy to observe the distinction. In some of the smaller forms it is not possible to make out the condition of the raphe even with a &ldquo;twelfth&rdquo;.<br> Again there are degrees of complexity. With many forms there is no doubt; but constantly forms occur whose obliquity is so complex or whose complexity is so slight that the observer is puzzled. All this reminds one that Nature laughs at our artificial &ldquo;keys&rdquo; and &ldquo;species&rdquo;.<br><br> 

	<b>II-- Navicula viridis  NITZ,  var leptogongyla Gr.  (?)</b><br><br>
About three-fourths of the forms in the gathering consist of an unusual variety of Nav. Viridis. Its chief features are strong costae, a definitely rhomboid central space and a ralph which seems not to be complex. All these are characteristics of &ldquo;leptogongyla&rdquo;; but this form seems more ovate in shape than the type and considerably smaller.<br> However it is probably fairly accurately described by the above name. It is extremely interesting to note the number of its variants in this small gathering. Some forms lack one or two costae from one side of the central space, others lack them on both sides, giving a narrower or broader stauroneiform central space. This yields four variants. Then again forms with a broad stauroneiform space show a tendency to parallel instead of radiate striae. This seems an approach to Nav. Isostauron  others develop slightly capitate ends instead of rounded; this brings these very near to Nav. Interrupta. To crown the series one or two typical specimens of Nav. Interrupta have been found in the gathering.<br><br>
What can be said to all this? Are these all to be taken as distinct species or varieties? In his introduction to Pinnularia, Cleve remarks that the fresh-water Pinnularias pass into one another in such a way that the formation of good species or groups is a matter of great difficulty. Study of a number of instances similar to that described have caused the writer to think that it may be possible to find intermediates between the whole group, and that the vast Pinnularia family may be variants of a single fundamental form.<br><br>                                                                              

	<b>III.-- Navicula elliptica  Kutz,  var  costata  O'Meara.
</b><br><br>
Scattered among the other forms were a few specimens of Nav.elliptica. It is in that scattered condition that this diatom is usually found; though in a gathering from the Midlands last year this pretty form was found almost pure. A remarkable point here is the occurrence of a variant bearing strong costae instead of the normal punctae. The proportion is about one costae form to four normal. A search through the usual literature failed to reveal any reference to a costate elliptica.  At last in O'Meara's &ldquo;Irish Diatomaceae&rdquo; there was found a description of a form with which this was identical. Only once before has this variant been observed by the writer; this, too, was in an autumn gathering. It may perhaps be permitted to express a wonder whether this is a specially strengthened form adapted for the winter rest and cold. The photograph with this is somewhat disappointing but the diatom is both minute and extremely convex and therefore difficult to focus.

		<b><div style="text-align: center">TOPIC No 2 - GALLS</div></b><br>
<div style="text-align: center">



<div style="text-align: left">I heard a group of microscopists talking about Galls and for the life of me did not understand a word of what was said. So that being said I delved into the list of books and low and behold there was a book  'Provisional Keys to British Plant Galls'<br> 

So here we go on another episode, discovering about Plant Galls.<br><br>

Most branches of biology and natural history can be classified under the fauna or the flora, vertebrate or invertebrate , flowering or non flowering, but plant galls defy such neat designation. By definition, a gall consists of plant tissue in which the cells have been stimulated to increase in size or in number, or in both, by an intrusive organism. The relationship is parasitic, although a few examples show evidence of symbiosis. A gall is not an organism in its own right but rather it is a manifestation of reactions between two very different living things. It must not be regarded as a species, and is named by reference to both host and parasite.<br><br>

So hot foot in the hope of finding some galls I had a good  scrounge round our wooded area.<br><br> 

I have added a few photos of eggs laid by galls with the named parasite responsible.<br><br></p>

<b>The next piece is from A Guide to the Insects of Britain and Northern Europe By
Michael Chinery.</b><br><br>


<b>Superfamily Cynipoidea</b><br>
The members of this group are very small or minute insects with rather characteristic wing venation. The  gaster (that part of the abdomen in Hymenoptera which lies behind the 'waist')  is laterally compressed, more so in some species than in others, and the insects are generally dark in colour, althogh some are yellowish or reddish brown. Its members are of special interest because most of them induce gall formation on plants and many of them alternate between sexual and non- sexual generations.  They are called gall wasps. Each species induces formation of its own characteristic gall on the plant. Most are found on oaks but a few species attack roses and certain herbaceous plants.

<div style="text-align: center"><b>Extract from book by Richard Headstrom titled Nature in Miniature.</b></div>

In his Natural History Pliny tells us about galls, but much earlier Theophrastus knew of their medicinal and curative properties. So galls were familiar to the ancients, though they did not know what caused them; no one did, in fact, until 1686, when Malpighi came up with the answer. And he was only partially right, for not only are galls caused by insects, as he said but also by fungi, nematode worms, mites, and probably in some instances, mechanical irritation.<br><br>

Even today we have much to learn about the physiology of gall formation; nor do we know why any particular gall should have a distinctive shape. We know that the egg of the gall-making insect is laid on the host plant inserted in the tissues, and that when the larva emerges it makes its way to the meristematic tissues&mdash;that is, to the cells capable of dividing and multiplying-- because galls are formed only in such tissues. Once the larvae has reached these tissues it presumably secretes some substance that stimulates the cells to greater activity, causing them to multiply more than they would normally. The result is an abnormal growth, or gall.<br><br>

Meanwhile, as the gall develops the insect feeds on the tissues that compose it, at the same time secreting an enzyme which changes the starch of cells to sugar in the same way that the plant enzyme normally converts starch to sugar. This sugar in turn is used by the plant to form new cells, that not only provide food for the insect but also promote the growth of the gall, since more cells are produced than the insect can possibly eat. So both the plant and insect profit from the association.<br><br>

The study of galls and gall insects is a fascinating one, though in some respects it is complicated because we cannot always be sure the the insect which emerges from the gall is the one that made it: many insects do not make galls but lay their eggs in those made by others. Such insects are called 'guests' or inquilines. Furthermore, both the makers and the inquilines are attacked by parasitic hymenoptera, which only adds to our confusion, for it is not always easy to determine the interrelations of these insects . Many galls are complicated communities; for example the pinecone gall (Fig. 63A) is a veritable insect apartment house. This particular gall has been studied in considerable detail: in addition to its maker, as many as 31 different species, represented by 10 inquilines, 16 parasites, and 5 transients, have been found living in it.<br><br>

There is no evidence that the form of a gall is of any adaptive importance; it may be that the formation of any specific shape is purely mechanical. But the remarkable thing about galls is that those made by the same species of insect always have the same form, always occur on the same species of plant, and always appear on the same part of the plant, so those versed in gall lore may know the identity of the gall maker by merely looking at the gall.<br><br>

Galls occur on a wide variety of plants, but they are especially numerous on willows, oaks, roses, legumes, and the composites. They may be found on any part of the plant-- root, branch, stem, leaf, blossom, and even the seed. Some are rather inconspicuous, merely blisterlike swellings; others are hairy or pilelike; still others are suggestive of bullets; while those that occur on flowers or in flower clusters often make them look ravaged by fire. A few are grotesque and eye-catching.<br><br>

Few galls attract our eye as quickly as the oak apples, which may be so numerous on an oak tree as to suggest a fair crop of fruit on an apple tree. They are globular in shape (Fig 63B ), green while in the process of being formed, tough and firm in texture and an inch or two in diameter. To all appearances they look like small unripe apples. At first glance they may seem to grow directly from the buds, but a closer examination shows that each one is a deformed leaf, hanging by the leaf stem or petiole. If one is cut open with a sharp knife or razor blade and viewed with the lens it is seen to contain a juicy, spongy white substance and a large central larval cell holding a small grub or young gall wasp. (Fig 63 C). The larval cell in an oak apple spotted with red (Fig 63 D) is supported by radiating fibers instead of a spongy substance. (Fig 63 E)<br><br>

Some galls are very shallow such as the blister or spot galls found on asters and goldenrods. The spangle oak galls are thicker and look like shallow saucers. A few galls, such as the blueberry kidney gall (Fig 63 F). and the gouty oak gall, are quite woody. Galls often found on leaves of the witch hazel are conical, green, or green and reddish &ndash;tipped, and rather pretty (Fig63 G). Rose bushes invariably have a few spiny galls that are green or reddish and somewhat globular. The cockscomb gall is an irregular but comb-like greenish, red tipped  elevation formed on the veins of an elm leaf and resembling the comb of a cock.<br><br>

The oak fig gall, a cluster of many individual galls resembles a cluster of figs (Fig 63 H) and as seen with the lens, is covered with short fine hairs. Bullet galls (Fig 63 I) may appear singly or in clusters; they are yellow, sometimes tinged with red, and occur invariably on oaks. Sometimes maple leaves are thickly spotted with circular yellow, eyelike spots margined with cherry red (Fig 63 J). They are rather attractive.<br><br>
Few galls, however, have the eye appeal of the woolsower (Fig 63 K). Many  naturalists consider it one of the most beautiful objects in nature. Found on the twigs of various oaks, It is woolly, creamy white, and admirably set off with pinkish red blotches, the woolly growth containing seedlike grains. This is one object that must be looked at with the lens.<br><br>
