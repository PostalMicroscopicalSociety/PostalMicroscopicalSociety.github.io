<b>A query from Mo Vaughan.</b><br><br>

Please refer to the photos below of a holly leaf. What produces the coating of light green/brown sugar-like deposits? and how are they produced?<br> There are no aphids about yet so it is not aphids and nothing is feeding on them.<br> If someone can answer this mystery please <a href="mailto:librarian@postal-microscopical-society.org.uk">e-mail.</a>me.<br><br>

<b>From Mike Samworth who has had a letter from Mark Lawley.</b><br><br>

Mark Lawley writes;
"I'm aiming to give an account of the natural history of the central Welsh Marches from the Berwyns south to the Black Mountains, and as far west as Rhayader and east to the Clee Hills.<br><br>  

Most accounts of regional natural histories rather neglect less popular groups of invertebrates and cryptogamic plants, and few even mention microscopic groups such as nematodes, rotifers, protozoa, microfungi and algae.  I intend to include all these groups, and while it won't be possible to treat them comprehensively, of course, I do wish to remind readers that there's much more to natural history than birds, blooms and butterflies.<br><br>

I'd like the book to be richly illustrated, particularly with images of forms of life that most people are unfamiliar with - hence my approach to the PMS.<br><br>
Collembola (springtails), Thysanura, Diplura, Protura, Psocoptera, and related groups<br>

Biting and sucking lice (e.g. Actornithophilus patellatus)<br>

Fleas (e.g. Hystrichopsylla talpae, Ceratophyllus styx)<br>

Mites (e.g. Scutacarus acarorum on bees, Dermanyssus species, Megninia strigis-otis, Protalges attenuatus, water mites)<br>

 Tardigrades,  Centipedes and millipedes<br>

 Crustacea (e.g. cladocera such as Daphnia, ostracods, copepods, Chirocephalus diaphanus, fish-lice, Gammarus pulex, Armadillidium pictum, Pentostomida)<br>

 Molluscs (e.g. some of the small snails and bivalves)<br>

 Annelids (e.g. oligochaetes, Theromyzon tessulatum)<br>

 Nematodes (e.g. a typical free-living roundworm, and parasites such as Syngamus trachea, Tetrameres sp., Porrocaecum spp., microfilariae)<br>

Hairybacks (Gastrotricha) and Horsehair worms (Nematomorpha)<br>

 Flatworms (Trematoda) - free-living turbellarians, flukes, tapeworms (e.g. Echinococcus granulosus).  For flukes, are photos of their various larval forms available (miracidia, cercaria, etc.)?<br><br>  

Images should be of species that are either known from the Marches or are very likely to occur there, although of course photographs don't need to be of organisms collected in the region.  I'd also be keen to hear from any PMS members who live in the Marches, and/or who have suggestions about species not listed below that would be worth including."<br><br>

So, if you feel you can contribute, due to where you live, or that you may have photographs suitable, then do <A HREF="mailto:secretary@postal-microscopical-society.org.uk">get in touch</A>, and I will pass this on to Mark.<br>Mike Samworth.<br><br>

<b>A note from the PMS Treasurer.</b><br><br>
Dear members, <br><br>
I am pleased to tell you that the Quekett Microscopical Club has given a grant to the PMS of £400 per year for the next three years. This is to be used in accordance with their charitable objectives in promoting education and interest in microscopy.<br>
These welcome funds will be used to ensure that meetings are free to all, and are open to all. Both will hopefully encourage new people to attend. The balance will be used to continue to improve Balsam Post and keep costs down. <br>

On behalf of the PMS and its members, I would like to thank the Quekett for its generous donation.<br><br>
Mike Smith, Hon treasurer.<br><br>

Letter from <b>John A Moran.</b><br><br>
I am seeking information on a Gillett and Sibert Conference microscope.<br>

I have conducted intensive searches of the Internet and ploughed through innumerable blogs, and found almost nothing - except for some details provided by Mick Chaplin (info originating from Keih Brocklehurst).<br>
 
Amazingly, Elcomatic just said it's over 50 years old and no longer supported.<br>
 
I can't believe that there aren't a couple of manuals hiding out there somewhere - it's just finding a way to attract their owner's attention that's the problem.<br>

If you can help then please contact me..<br> 
Thank you.<br><br>

Letter from Chris Thomas.</b><br><br>Have blogged <a href="http://miltoncontact.blogspot.com/2010/11/hair-raising-book-to-leaf-through.html" target="_blank">an article</a>

that is really applicable to us microscopists - a way to create an
online book to leaf through for free using issuu.com. It is similar to
YouTube, but for book, magazine and catalogue publishers -

a possible adapted text for both web and the Balsam Post.<br>

"I blame my wife! She came home with the comment "Someone sent a digital
document to us today at work that you could leaf through like a book on
screen. I though it might be an idea for you". Not just for me - PMS
members might like to give it a try!<br>

Cue detailed internet search, which finally hit gold when I found the issuu.com web site. It is the equivalent of YouTube, but for
publishers of books, magazines and catalogues.<br><br>

    * You design your document in Word or as a PDF<br>
    * Upload the document to Issuu<br>
    * They convert it and store the document online<br>
    * You can make the document public or private<br>
    * Embed the document to your site, blog and/or Facebook<br>
    * You can e-mail a link to contacts<br>
    * Specify whether visitors can download a PDF or not.<br><br>

I prepared a quick photobook straight away that evening, using
photographs of hair samples taken from a PMS Box and from my collection
that I had to hand just to test out the system and was impressed! Have a
look yourself at <br><a href="http://issuu.com/miltoncontact/docs/hair-in-colour" target="_blank">issuu.com/miltoncontact/docs/hair-in-colour.</a>
 <br>

If you have or are preparing your own book or editing photographs taken
through the microscope, consider creating a Issuu book version to share
with us all. Registration for the basic service is free - check it out

Letter from <b>Mo Vaughan.</b><br><br>Happy New Year to All members.
I noticed the letters section is hardly used but I know there is a wealth of microscopical knowledge out there.<br><br>
The reason I write this is because I received a box of slides in the post as I am on a circuit.  These slides were Diatoms placed on an aluminium slide, really effective, and the diatoms were themselves a marvel to look at.<br><br>
I have a couple of questions I would like to put to the membership:<br><br>
1. Is it possible to stain the shell of diatoms to accentuate the beautiful structures that they create?<br><br>
2. Where or how does one get hold of aluminium slides or do they have to be made up?<br><br>
 
If you can help me in my questions then please <A HREF="mailto:librarian@postal-microscopical-society.org.uk">e-mail me</A>,<br>

Letter from <b>Keith Brocklehurst.</b><br><br>
    Early in February 2005 Helmut Reichenauer, a microscopist and, apparently a wine merchant ,from Vienna, enquired about blue-light fluoresence microscopy without resorting to epi-illumination. He owns a Zeiss Axioskop which he is investigating adapting with either Q/I light source or UV LEDs for this technique.<br><br>
    I sent details of the Gillett & Siebert Conference microscope which was ideal for this work with a 100W Q/I light source and a massive field condenser, together with examples of acceptable results. I received the following reply from Helmut who can be contacted  via his <a href="http://www.VinsDeVignerons.com" target="_blank">website</a><br>       
Click on French Flag and navigate to 'Botanik' to see his excellent micrographs.     K.B.<br><br>
 
Dear Keith,
 
many thanks for your comments of last week plus the 3 impressive photographs. This is exactly the type of work which I would envisage for some time in the foreseeable future, which had prompted me to take you up on the comments in your PMS letter.  ......  but your guess is right, that basically I would like to do BLFl with my Axioskop, if at all possible. I will therefore pursue your suggestion of the adaptation of a suitable quartz halogen lamp to start with, whilst watching the growing offer of UV LED's on the side. For example<br><br>
 
http://shop.dotlight.de/shop/product_info.php/products_id/41?osCsid=27ab15137f7ba82f6a8fa43ecc5ee97d with data sheet at http://shop.dotlight.de/datasheets/ETG-5UV400-30.pdf<br><br>
 
http://www.eska-technik.com/shop/pi505842317.htm?categoryId=36<br><br>
 
show just 2 examples of UV LED's found in Google with keyword 'UV LED'.<br><br>
 
Will discuss your suggestions and these options with my 'local microscopical advisor' and keep you posted if any significant step forward is achieved.<br>
 
With kind regards from Vienna<br>
 
Helmut Reichenauer<br><br>
 
PS.: My current white LED illumination is a Conrad 1 W single LED unit, which was locally adapted to my Axioskop one year ago. Meanwhile Zeiss are offering multiLED-units (a 3 x 3 LED matrix) for their new range of AxioImager microscopes. Multi LED arrangements can also be found at<br><br> http://www.eska-technik.com/shop/pi1694187592.htm?categoryId=29 <br><br>but I have not yet investigated this further.<br><br>

Letter from <b>Ross R. Grunwald.</b><br><br>
Hello Mike,<br><br>
On December 9, 2003, I listed a request for an ocular for my Vickers M72C scope.  A few weeks ago I was contacted by James Battersby, who had read my request and sent me five oculars that fit my microscope.  I cannot thank you enough for providing the vehicle that allowed me to complete my scope.  I have been searching for nearly a year without success in any other venue.  
If I can assist the society in any way, please let me know.  I live in central California, USA, near San Francisco.<br>
 
Of course, you can remove my listing from your website.<br>

 
Thanks again.<br>

<B>10 May 2004:</B><BR>
Letter from <b>Bob Town (concessions for PMS, etc. members)</b>.<br><br>

Dear Mike,<br><br>

I have known about the activities of the PMS for many years being a 
keen amateur microscopist myself (<i>Bob was involved in the provision 
of Auto-Montage for the PMS - refer to Digital Imaging section under PMS Groups</i>).<br><br>
I don't know if this is appropriate news or not for the PMS 
membership, but they may be interested to know that my company is a 
new UK supplier of microscopes specialising in the import of 
microscopes direct from the largest microscope manufacturing plant in 
China. As the microscopes are sourced direct and not through a chain 
of middlemen the prices we offer are exceptionally low.<br><br>

The microscopes are branded as GX Microscopes (the Chinese brand 
name is too unintelligible to be used!) and they are of very high 
quality from the same factory that turns out microscopes for Nikon and Olympus.<br><br>

We do not normally sell direct to end users and we are in the process 
of setting up a number of UK distributors. However, to get the brand 
known, I am prepared to offer the microscopes direct to members of a 
few selected organisations (e.g. PMS, Quekett, Royal Entomological 
Society). Furthermore there will be a promotional price valid for the 
first year (ends 1st May 2005).<br><br>

You can download the catalogue and some datasheets from the web site <a href="http://www.gxmicroscopes.com/"target="_blank">www.gxmicroscopes.com</a>. I can also send printed catalogues on request. The promotional price is indicated in the Concession Price 
column. Members wishing to order must provide us with their membership 
number (I assume there is such a thing).<br><br>

As for my company we are called GT Vision Ltd, we have offices in the 
UK and USA and you can see from our main website that we have a great 
deal of expertise in the field of advanced microscopy and imaging <a href="http://www.gt-vision.com/"target="_blank">www.gt-vision.com.</a><br><br> 
 
Incidentally, I don't know if you do this sort of thing or not but I 
could put a link on my GT Vision website to the PMS website, 
especially if you reciprocate.<br>

I look forward to hearing from you.<br>

Kindest regards,<br>

Bob Town.

<br><br>
Hello Mick,
    As far as I can make out your specimen from a Bernard Hartley slide is Asteromphalus heptactis (Breb) Ralfs in Pritchard.
Kindest regards
Klaus<br>
<i>Thanks very much for responding to my letter of so long ago (yours is the only response I've had). Armed with your suggestion I went exploring on the Web and found a  <a href="http://www-odp.tamu.edu/publications/172_SR/chap_08/c8_10.htm" target="_blank">useful site</a>. This gives lists of diatoms with links to pictures. I tracked down A heptactis and while I agree it has the same asymmetric structure, I think the general structure is more like Asterolampra marylandica, which unfortunately is symmetrical. Perhaps there has been some cross-breeding! I think there is still some mileage in tracking this down further. Anyone out there with further suggestions?

Letter from Derek Christie.
<br><br>
Hi Mike,<br><br>

I tried Alan Hadley's <a href="http://www.hadleyweb.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk" target="_blank">CombineZ program</a> a couple of nights ago and was both
surprised and pleased to find that it really works.

I was looking at a specimen of a diatom (Aulodiscus) from my recent PMS box.
This was a fairly "thick" diatom and only a few parts were in focus at any
one position of the fine focus control.

I took about 10 images of the diatom using my Coolpix 950, incrementing the
microscope focus setting for each one. Following Alan Hadley's instruction I
loaded up the images and ran the program. I was very pleased with the
results and I have appended an image of two of the focus planes and the
final CombineZ result for you to look at.<br><br>

<b>Microscope bulbs.</b>
Hello there,
One of the most frequently asked questions, among the microscopy fraternity is "Do you know where I can get a bulb for such and such a microscope?"

<B>Light Source Supplies</B>.  Unit 3, Keepers Cottage Barns, West Barsham,
Norfolk. NR21 9NL [Tel.no. 01328 853333] is an excellent, and helpful supplier.
The only slight problem is that their minimum order is £25.00. As most bulbs cost in the region of £12.00 or so each, this is not too much of a snag, it only means you buy a spare.<br><br>

 <B>Member's Web Site.</B><BR>


<br><br>Dear Mike,<br>

I was wondering if you would include my web site address in the "Related
Links" section of the PMS web site. I have a few images made using Bernard
Hartley, PMS slides in the Algae/diatoms/Darkfield diatoms section of my
site. I will be adding more PMS slide images when the boxes start to flow
again.<br>

Please have a browse around my site and, if you think that it is suitable
(and good enough), add it to your list.<br>

 <B>Balsam Post: Plankton Net Making by Ernie Ives.</B><BR>

In the past I have tried to make nets but my lack of sewing skill has resulted in very poor results. So full marks to Ernie for suggesting contact adhesive to make the seams. I have tried his method and the results are very acceptable.<br>
One problem I did have was the lack of suitable material for making the frame. However those black plastic flower pots which come from the garden centre came to the rescue! I took two identical ones.(The 2 litre size has a top diameter of about 17cm, just right for the net I was making.).First cut away the rim and about 3cm of side wall from one pot using kitchen scissors and coat the inside of the rim and wall with contact adhesive. Do the same with the other pot, but this time with 4cm of side wall, and coat the outside with adhesive.Paint a 5cm band around the mouth of the net with adhesive and allow all to dry.Place the 4cm walled rim inside the mouth of the net and press the material firmly onto the rim.Carefully slide the 3cm walled rim up the outside of the net from the bottom and press it into place so that the net is sandwiched between the two plastic rims.
Now make some holes for the bridle and all is done.<br>

Best wishes to all,
Fr David, Hilgay, Norfolk.<br><br>

 <B>PMS Slide box 96/33.</B><BR>
Dear Editor,
I have just recently finished with PMS slide box no.96/33 which contained diatom slides by Bernard
Hartley.<br>
I was absolutely delighted with this set of slides and enjoyed every minute I spent examining the diatoms.<br>
I thought that I might send you some images of these diatoms for the enjoyment of other members who have access to the internet.<br>

I have attached 3 images to this email:<br>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><a href="dgroup.html">a group of pennate diatoms in darkfield</a></li>
  <li><a href="centric.html">two views of the same centric diatom</a></li>
  <li><a href="valve.html">a valve view of a marine diatom?</a></li>
</ul>
Diatoms are new to me so identification is still a problem. If anyone out there can identify these
diatoms, I would be pleased to hear from them.<br>

Many thanks to Bernard Hartley and regards to all PMS members,<br>

Derek Christie (PMS).

 1) Microscope bulbs.</B><BR>
 Hello There,<br>
One of the most frequently asked questions, among the microscopy fraternity is "Do you know where I can get a bulb for such and such a microscope?"<br>
 
Light Source Supplies, Benbow Lane, Bishops Stortford. CM23 2NA.  [Tel.01279 652 143] is an excellent, and helpful supplier.<br>

The only slight problem is that their minimum order is £25.00. As most bulbs cost in the region of £12.00 or so each, this is not too much of a snag, it only means you buy a spare.<br>
<b>2) Incorrect/out of date adverts.<br>
</b>With reference to my other e-mail on Light Bulbs, I sent an e-mail to Peter Nicholson in response to his ad, re. bulbs. It came back "Unable to Deliver" and several weeks ago I supplied Lawrence Hartley with copies of the Patholux manual he needed..His request is still advertised.<br>
To cut down on trying to help those, who give an incorrect, or outdated,  Email address, and replying to outdated ads. which is a waste of ones time, would it therefore be a good idea to put a time limit on these ads? <br>
 Cheers,<br>
Sidney.<br>
<i>Thanks for the bulb information, this sort of information can be invaluable; the supplier has been added to the Useful Addresses section of Sales and Wants. Following your suggestion, I have changed the wording at the head of the Sales and Wants section.</i>

 <B>New member background notes.</B><BR>
Dear Mick,<BR> 
I have recently joined the PMS & noted the web site allows for personal information to be placed on it.
Thus I am sending a fair bit of stuff for you to pick the bones out & put on the address page.
Thanks.
Here goes: -<BR>

Interests: microscopy, astronomy, earth science, chemistry, biology &ndash; particularly cell science, microbiology & biochemistry.<BR> I have reached 1st year BSc level of education. Computing (just getting into the internet) is now a large part of my life.<BR>
Basically self taught in microscopy but formally instructed when doing my college courses. Main areas of interest in microscopy are petrology & crystal slides together with anything  &ldquo;polarisable&rdquo;. I have in the order of 200+ thin sections of rock, plus a small quantity of ceramic sections. I also have a selection of chemicals & crystal slides. If any one is interested I can send a copy of the lists to them & they can borrow a selection of the slides I have, or small quantities of chemicals can be forwarded, if they wish to make their own.<BR>
I am going back now thirty years but I also have small quantities of microbiological media from before the H&S Act took real force & stopped the general purchasing except from a recognised lab address &
again I would be glad to help out any one.<BR>
Much obliged, Peter<BR><BR>
<I>Thanks for your details and generous offers Peter. Why not add a box of slides for the circuits?</I><BR><BR>

 <B>Notes and Queries on the Intel Microscope.</B><BR>Hi,<BR>
New to the society (well it is actually my 6 yr old daughter, Sopie, who is
the member) so hello all. Reading the latest issue of Balsam post I saw a
note asking about the Intel computer microscope. That is the microscope
Sophie has so here are my quick views on it.<BR>
If your computer is suitable (Win 98 and a USB port, most PCs less than a
couple of years old should be fine) setting up the microsope is no problem.
Once installed you can easily get some nice pictures of various things using
the built in reflected or transmitted light sources. These can be easily
exported to your favorite imaging software. My only critisism is that there
is no fine focus and the depth of field is very tight so focusing takes a
bit of practice. Attached is a <A HREF="intelmic.html">polarised light picture</A> of a micro-gabbro
thin section which was done using the x10 setting and a couple of polarising
filters I had in my camera bag so not exactly high tech! The focusing could
be much better as the filters just got in the way, I have other sharper pics
but none here at work to include. Any comments on this first attempt are
welcome.<BR>
>From my perspective I know I can get as good an image from this as I have in
scopes at work which cost several times more. Maybe not an instrument for
the more demanding users out there but certainly better than its marketing
as a toy suggests.

 <B>Follow up to Mermaid's Purse Structures (see below).</B><BR>
 I have now received some information from Dr Stephen Harris regarding the
sponge section shown previously. The common name should of course be
Mermaid's glove not purse (though she probably carries both). His comments
are as follows:<BR><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you for the slide of Haliclona occulata.. This is definitely of animal
origin and appears to be a sponge. Haliclona is in the class Demospongiae
which has its main structure formed from spongin fibres, hence calcareous or
silicaceous spicules would not be expected, even before treatment with
hydrofloric acid. The areas of tissue that look like the conceptacles of
Fucoid algae are in fact aggregations of a cell type known as choanocytes,
these have a flagellum (many of these are seen filling the atrium) and the
basal cell is stained densely purple. At the base of the flagellum of each
of these cells is a contractile collar, which is not visible on the slide -
probably because of the fixation. In order to maintain the collar intact
around these cells it is often necessary to relax the sponge using something
like magnesium chloride solution or cocaine, before fixing the sponge.
Choanocytes are responsible for moving water through the sponge and
obtaining food.

 <B>Mermaid's Purse (?) Structures.</B><BR>
I recently sectioned a specimen collected and identified as Mermaid's Purse
sponge by Ray Parkinson. I am intrigued by the structures visible in the
attached digital photomicrograph but have no idea what they are. None of my
reference books are helpful and I wonder if any PMS member can supply
information. I should add that processing of the material included treatment
with hydrofluoric acid so the absence of any silicacious spicules may be an
artefact. I mention this because the identity of the specimen as a sponge
has been queried mainly on this basis.<BR>To see the photomicrograph <A HREF="mermaid.html">click here.</A><BR><BR>

Extract from a letter from Carla Corazza.:<BR><BR>
I would like information on solutions used in pitfall traps.I am looking for one which do not attract selectively some groups of invertebrates, that is, I do not want to use a solution like those which are used to collect, for example, Carabid beetles: I wish that all the animals have the same probability to be caught because I am trying to get information on the whole community of invertebrates walking on the soil surface.<BR> In the past, I used a solution of potassium bicromate
(K2Cr2O7) but it is too dangerous and it damages specimens. Sometimes we put traps in areas where tourists, dogs and children go: it is another reason why  preferring a not dangerous solution.<BR>
I used some traps containing water saturated with NaCl and I found that
animals were very well preserved, even in the hot season, for more than two
weeks (drying of traps for evaporation was completely avoided by the
overturned transparent plastic cup put three-four centimeters over the trap).<BR>

Pit-fall traps are a really imperfect sampling tool but they give many
information anyway!<BR><BR><BR>

Letter from Keith Brocklehurst:<BR><BR>
Dear Webmaster,
        Congratulations on opening a web site for the Postal Microscopical Society. Perhaps you will allow me to use the site to spread awareness about blue-light fluorescence as a simple colourful technique for the amateur microscopist.
    Fluorescence techniques are traditionally ignored because they are believed to require mercury vapour ultra-violet light sources for illumination - expensive and can be dangerous - but, given a quartz halogen light source, only two filters and a fluorochrome are required for blue-light fluorescence work. These are not too difficult to acquire in a friendly society such as ours. 
    The principle is simple to understand. Quartz halogen light has plenty of blue light in it run at full voltage. The substage exciter filter, known as a BG12, passes only blue light from the visible spectrum which illuminates the specimen, say a smear of cheek cells mounted in a very dilute solution of fluorochrome such as acridine orange or coriphosphine. The fluorochrome combines with nuclear DNA and causes it to fluoresce green. It can also combine with compounds in bacterial cell walls and make them fluoresce red. Between objective and eyepiece, or even in a cardboard holder dropped over the eyepiece an orange green filter (OG1) stops all blue light so the specimen appears on a dark background with green nuclei and red bacteria on the cell surfaces - quite spectacular and aesthetically pleasing, as are many dark ground images.
    The illustrations, I hope speak for themselves. I can assure you that there is lots to explore in biological material using this technique. Pathologists have been heavily committed to human material and have not explored pollen grain germination epidermal peels, microfungi, ciliates or rotifers. Anyone who owns a Gillett & Sibert Conference microscope may not know that it is ideally suited to this work. Try it; you will not be disappointed, and by all means use me as a helpline if there is a need.<BR><BR>
                                         Yours sincerely,<BR>

Dear PMS members,

anyone who wishes to share their e-mail address with other PMS members
can easily do so by e-mailing Mick Chaplin, the organiser of this PMS
website, or myself as secretary of the PMS. Addresses need not be
published on paper, but each member would be kept up to date with the
list of other members. It seems a great way for members to share ideas,
ask questions of others, or whatever.
