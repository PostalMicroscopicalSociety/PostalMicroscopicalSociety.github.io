<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial">BALSAM POST - The Fred

Loxton Decade - 1992 to 2002</FONT></B></CENTER></P>



<P><CENTER><B>by Chris Thomas</B></CENTER></P>



<P>The Balsam Post is the newsletter of the Postal Microscopical

Society, with articles by members for anyone who shares our passion

in microscopy. In March 1992, the first Balsam Post under the

new editorship of Fred Loxton appeared. He introduced himself

with the modest but telling words</P>



<P><I>&quot; When I was first asked if I would accept the job

of editing this magazine, I had some reservations. On reflection,

I realised that this was a job that I could do and I finally accepted

with enthusiasm.&quot;</I></P>



<P>Over the next decade, he fulfilled that promise! Fred was the

successful editor of the Balsam Post from 1992 to early 2002,

before handing on the baton to Steve Gill.</P>



<P>The Balsam Post as a newsletter with comments and articles

had its origins about a decade earlier. Barry Ellam, microscopical

raconteur, began expanding the newsletter of a few factual photocopied

pages with additional comments and notes on subjects microscopical

which he thought might interest the reader. Ernie Ives then offered

to help with the editing of the newsletter and included articles

by other members of the society as a way of sharing our enthusiasm,

tricks of the trade and successes and failures. Ernie edited the

Balsam Post for next eight years with issues extending now to

20 to 30 printed pages and appearing at least twice a year. There

were contributions by a variety of authors, including many who

have made regular contributions right up to the present time.

Keeping a newsletter going takes a lot of commitment and in 1991,

after making the Balsam Post an integral feature of the PMS, Ernie

felt it was time for someone else to take over.</P>



<P>Fred carefully built upon the work of his predecessor whilst

retaining the unique informal nature of the Balsam Post. The size

of each issue increased to between 30 to 40 pages and the number

of issues per year gradually increased to four. This required

a professionalism that ensured that copy kept coming in, that

people were willing to contribute and that it was all kept within

budget. But this was all done unassumingly in the background,

for to outward appearances, the Balsam Post was (and still is)

a friendly informal affair in which the authors expouse their

interests and experiences in their own words. This is no mean

task! People who have to review articles by other people can always

find corrections to be done or better phrasings and would find

it difficult not to offer suggestions. However, my experience,

and that of other contributors, was that if you submitted an article

to the Balsam Post then you would see it practically unchanged

in print. Fred had a remarkable restraint and yet would help those

with an article if they desired. Thus he ensured that the Balsam

Post was a true mouthpiece of its (article contributing) members.

All the articles of this period are indexed in linked pages to

this one and give an idea of the wide interests represented by

the PMS.</P>



<P>My own involvement with the Balsam Post began in 1994 when

Brian Darnton asked me to do an illustration for one of his articles

on diatoms which was used for the cover of the July issue. When

approached, Fred encouraged me to submit more images for both

in and on the Balsam Post. Hesitantly at first and then with increasing

frequency, I found myself trying to provide pictures for the newsletter.

Fred's low key but supportive attitude to contributions had a

key influence on my direction as an illustrator and microscopist.

I learnt that what you saw in a sample was equally dependent on

both the eye and on knowledge gained from reading about the subject

and you can go to the linked pages with Balsam Post covers to

see the results.</P>



<P>While many of us know 'Fred Loxton, the Editor', fewer know

of his multiple other interests. He enjoys old slides and is one

of the few people who will successfully tackle repairing them.

Papered slides were an attractive feature of Victorian microscopy

and Fred has also developed the skill of their preparation. Cameras

and photography gear are another interest which he will hopefully

have time to pursue again, this time adding the trials and tribulations

of digital imaging and processing to his increasing store of knowledge.

An avid reader of factual history books, he has also started learning

bookbinding as a skill - very useful for those older microscopy

books that need some TLC. If that were not enough, the man is

also an active swimmer!</P>



<P>Fred can look back on a successful and distinctive 10 years

of the Balsam Post and look forward to re-immersing himself in

his interests. Naturally we look forward to reading about them

in the Balsam Post!</P>
