Principles of Auto-Montage:</font>

<font face="Arial" size=2><ul type="disc">

 <li>



The application takes in a series of images taken at discrete levels in an object and automatically stitches them together to produce a single image.</li><li>Only the in-focus parts of each image are used, which means that the final montage image is in focus over the whole of the object.</li><li> Different stitching algorithms are provided in order to optimise the result for any particular object.</li><li>The application also retains the level information for each portion of in-focus image used and is able to use this information to generate pseudo-stereo views of the object ("pseudo" because only one viewing angle is used).</li></ul></font></td></tr>

         <P align=left><font face="Arial" size=3>

What Auto-Montage Requires:</font>

<font face="Arial" size=2><ul type="disc">

<li>

 

Suitable focus level change between adjacent images:</li><ul type="disc"><li>Adjacent images should be taken at a spacings within the depth of focus of the microscope lenses.</li><li>If the steps are too far apart then Auto-Montage will not be able to produce good correlation between adjacent  images.</li><li> Ideally the depth of focus of the lens system should be calculated and a calibrated focus knob used to provide accurate and equal steps between images.</li><li>In practice it is usually satisfactory to set the steps by feel - all those shown here were photographed in this way.</li></ul></ul></font></td></tr>



<tr>	  <td width="100%" valign="top" align="left" >    



         <P align=left><font face="Arial" size=2><ul type="disc">

 <li>

Good contrast over whole image:</li><ul type="disc"><li>Image lighting is very important. Areas of low contrast will not be used correctly in the montaged image and will appear to float out of place in the stereo views.</li><li>Auto-Montage does provide a manual clone tool for correcting such defects, but it is awkward and time-consuming to use.</li><li>Top-lit objects can be prone to having parts in shadow or washed out highlights.</li><li>The ideal lighting system would be a bright but diffuse vertical top light.</li><li>Transmitted light objects should ideally not have areas which are very dark, or conversely very light.</li><li>Some image processing can be carried out in computer, to alleviate the worst problems, but it would be very time consuming on a large series of images.</li></ul></ul></font></p></td></tr>

Tips for Producing a Satisfactory Series of Images:</font>

<font face="Arial" size=2><ul type="disc">

 <li>

Focus through the full range of the object, noting the features at the highest and lowest points in the object; these will act as markers for starting and ending the series.</li>

<li>The direction of focus is not important as the whole series can be inverted in Auto-Montage.</li>

<li> Start at one end of the focus range and take small enough steps to ensure that the image detail only changes slightly between shots (unless you are using the pre-calculated steps).</li>



<li>Try to make each step equal, in terms of focus knob angle turned through.</li>



<li>Use a remote release on the camera (e.g. air bulb) to minimise the chance of disturbing the set up.</li>

<li>In particular sit as still as possible and, with unmounted specimens be careful not to disturb them by breathing on them during a photo session.</li></ul></font></td></tr>

Examples of Series Which have Proved Satisfactory:</font><br>

<font face="Arial" size=2><ul type="disc">



<li>House fly head:</li><ul type="disc"><li>

The top-lit, unmounted, head filled the camera frame height and 36 images were taken. If some object appendage, such as an antenna, protrudes significantly then proportionately more images will be required.</li></ul>



<li>Mounted blowfly labella:</li><ul type="disc"><li>

The labella filled the camera frame and 13 images were taken.</li>



<li>Images used were 1600 * 1200 pixels, and Auto-Montage stalls on images bigger than this, although it is not clear that this is a limitation of the application.</li></ul></ul></font></td></tr>



<tr>	  <td width="100%" valign="top" align="left" >    



         <P align=left><font face="Arial" size=3>

An Ideal Setup:</font><br>

<font face="Arial" size=2><ul type="disc">



<li>

Microscope with trinocular head.</li>

<li>

Versatile, controllable lighting.</li>

<li>

Digital camera fitted with adapted, high eyepoint, wide-field eyepiece.</li>

<li>

Remote camera release.</li>

<li>

Colour monitor to connect to the camera to give an enlarged image for checking image focus.</li>

<li>

Computer with means for taking in images from camera.</li>

<li>

Image processing software for detailed checking of images (e.g. PaintShopPro or PhotoShop).</li>

<li>

CD writer for transferring images to CD for easy interchanging of images for processing by Auto-Montage.</li></ul></font></p></td></tr>

         <P align=left><font face="Arial" size=3>

<b>Note:</b></font><br>

<font face="Arial" size=2>



Alignment between images taken through a stereo microscope will shift sideways, significantly, as the focus is changed, but Auto-Montage can cope with misalignment between images and automatically compensates in both X and Y directions.<br><br>
