He was a very keen microscopist and knowledgeable zoologist, who was always eager to assist those wishing to extend their knowledge and yet was never too proud to learn new ideas and techniques from others.  Keith always supported PMS activities and for some years was on the PMS committee, first as membership secretary then as 'Anchor Man'.He enthusiastically took part in Field Study Centre weekends, contributed some 20 articles to Balsam Post and was involved in many presentations at PMS meetings. His interest in springtails led him to discover 2 species new to the UK. A full obituary will appear in the January 2012 issue of Balsam Post.

<b>Note:</b> The Related Sites section no longer uses frames to keep the PMS navigation bar always in sight (not always successful anyway, as some sites are quite possessive of your screen space) but opens a new browser window each time you visit a new related site.
