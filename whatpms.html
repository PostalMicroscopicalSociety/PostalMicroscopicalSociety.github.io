This is still the aim today when, after fluctuating fortunes over the years, a membership of around 240 contributes to a lively and friendly society.<br>In 1998 the PMS celebrated 125 years of existence. To commemorate this event, Klaus Kemp produced microscope slides using diatoms. A photomicrograph of one of the slides is shown below.<br><br></font>

          <font face="Arial" size=2><BR><BR><B><FONT SIZE=+3>More Details</FONT></B><BR><BR>The Postal Microscopical Society was founded in 1873, with its principal objective, the circulation of boxes of microslides illustrating the work of members and/or that of professional mounters.This is still the main function of the Society. Members are organised into 'Circuits'. Boxes of microslides are circulated, accompanied by notebooks in which each recipient records his comments, criticism, and perhaps additional notes on the mounts themselves, before passing the box on to the next member on the 'circuit'. Membership of the Society is open of anyone interested in the Microscope.<BR><BR>

Currently, boxes are despatched at three week intervals. Thus, each member
receives roughly twenty boxes per year. As each box will
normally contain 12 slides, each member has the opportunity to study many different microslides during the year. It is rare indeed to receive a  box which  does  not provide a great deal of interest and enjoyment; often the difficulty is to part with it. Members are actively encouraged to participate, by making their own slides available for circulation, and this aspect is the 'life blood' of the Society. The members are mostly amateurs with an interest in the microscope and microscopy, so the subject matter varies greatly.<BR><BR>

The essence of the Society is the friendly and helpful interchange of information. Help is offered to beginners and experts alike by the maintenance of a <B>panel of experts</B> with experience or specialised knowledge in particular fields. Thus, help is only a postage stamp/phone call/email away and the beginner has access to a mine of information.<BR><BR>

'<B>Balsam Post</B>' the Newsletter of the Society, is now published four times  a  year.  Written  by  the members for the  members,  this is another source of advice, news,  help  and  guidance. The  aim  is  to  provide  information  but without  too  much  scientific jargon.  PMS  help  is  intended  to  be practical and helpful. There are currently many back issues which can be supplied and these alone provide a mine of reading and helpful information. All members are encouraged to write for Balsam Post on any subject allied to microscopy and natural history. The cost of publication is covered by the general funds of the Society so all members receive the current editions free, by post of course.  A comprehensive index is now available.<BR><BR>


Members have access to their own <B>library</B> of books on Microscopy and Natural History. The current list can be found on the Library page. The Librarian maintains the club stock of books which are available on request to members. The Society pays the postage out but the borrower is expected to pay the return postage. The Library also contains a number of videos covering the techniques of slide  making  which  are  available  to  members.<BR><BR>

<B>Meetings</B> are held in May and October each year and the Annual general meeting is an
opportunity is to combine this with a general meeting and exhibition of microscopy. This is the only non postal function that can be arranged, for with members spread all over the UK and beyond it is, inevitably, impossible for all members to make the journey.<BR><BR>

If you are interested enough to contact the secretary you will receive the current edition of 'Balsam Post', hopefully this will encourage you to join.<BR><BR>

It is appreciated that some members for various reasons, do not wish to participate in the slide circulation section of the Society. For those who wish to be associated, but just do not have the time, or for whatever other reason, do  not  wish  to  receive  the  boxes,  an alternative 'Off Circuit' membership is available at a reduced fee. All the  other  facilities  and  advantages, including  'Balsam  Post'  are provided for these members.<BR><BR><BR>
